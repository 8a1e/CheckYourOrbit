READ THIS!
OrbitGuard is a React + TypeScript web app built for Hackathon '25 to help satellite operators detect and respond to orbital threats like conjunction events and solar storms (CMEs). To run it, you’ll need Node.js installed (LTS version recommended — it includes npm) and Visual Studio Code. Once you’ve unzipped the OrbitGuard folder, open it in VS Code (File → Open Folder), then open the terminal (Ctrl + ~) and run npm install to install all the required packages. After that, run npm start — this will launch the React app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
